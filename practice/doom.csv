Minutes,"The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists changes its format from a newsletter to a magazine. Its first cover features a clock, both conceptualized and designed by artist Martyl Langsdorf. At the time, Langsdorf designed it because “it seemed the right time on the page … it suited my eye.” This purely aesthetic design later becomes known as the “Doomsday Clock,” one of the most recognizable and lasting icons in popular culture to convey the urgency of nuclear danger. For decades to come, the Clock’s hands move based upon whether events push humanity closer to or further from nuclear apocalypse. The Clock later includes dangers posed by climate change and other existential threats.","The Doomsday Clock is a design that warns the public about how close we are to destroying our world with dangerous technologies of our own making. It is a metaphor, a reminder of the perils we must address if we are to survive on the planet.
 
The Doomsday Clock was created in 1947 by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. At the time, the greatest danger to humanity came from nuclear weapons, in particular from the prospect that the United States and the Soviet Union were headed for a nuclear arms race. The Bulletin considered possible catastrophic disruptions from climate change in its hand-setting deliberations for the first time in 2007.
 
The Bulletin’s Science and Security Board meets twice a year to discuss world events and reset the clock as necessary. The board is made up of scientists and other experts with deep knowledge of nuclear technology and climate science, who often provide expert advice to governments and international agencies. They consult widely with their colleagues across a range of disciplines and also seek the views of the Bulletin’s Board of Sponsors, which includes 13 Nobel Laureates.",The Clock Starts Running,30-12-1899 23:53:00,1947,7,420,468.50036,520.10327
Minutes,"In the fall, at a remote site in Central Asia, the Soviet Union explodes a nuclear device—the design of which is very similar to that of the bomb that the United States used on Japan four years earlier. The Soviets deny the test, but US President Harry Truman shares the news with the American public about it, and the arms race begins. The Bulletin explains, “We do not advise Americans that doomsday is near and that they can expect atomic bombs to start falling on their heads a month or year from now. But we think they have reason to be deeply alarmed and to be prepared for grave decisi",,The Arms Race is On,30-12-1899 23:57:00,1949,3,180,216.3119,665.73956
Minutes,"Over the opposition of many nuclear scientists, the United States decides to pursue the hydrogen bomb, a weapon far more powerful than any atomic bomb. In October 1952, the United States tests its first thermonuclear device, obliterating a Pacific Ocean islet in the process. Nine months later, the Soviets test an H-bomb of their own. “The hands of the Clock of Doom have moved again,” the Bulletin announces. “Only a few more swings of the pendulum, and, from Moscow to Chicago, atomic explosions will strike midnight for Western civilization.”",,The Horror of Hydrogen,30-12-1899 23:58:00,1953,2,120,145.39478,684.73379
Minutes,"Political actions belied the superpowers’ tough talk of “massive retaliation.” For the first time, the United States and the Soviet Union seek to avoid direct confrontation in regional conflicts such as the 1956 Egyptian-Israeli dispute. Joint projects to build trust and dialogue between third parties also help quell hostilities. Scientists initiate many of these measures: They help establish the International Geophysical Year, a series of coordinated, worldwide scientific events intended to raise public awareness, and the Pugwash Conferences, where Soviet and American scientists can interact.",,"Cooperation, not Confrontation",30-12-1899 23:53:00,1960,7,420,468.50036,520.10327
Minutes,"Within 10 days, the most acute crisis of the Cold War is resolved through discussions on Soviet missiles in Cuba. But founding editor Eugene Rabinowitch and the Bulletin community do not move the hands of the Clock. They view the events of the Cuban Missile Crisis as indicators of longer-term trends, understanding the successful resolution of the crisis and the creation of a dedicated communication channel between Washington and Moscow to be positive steps leading toward the first significant arms-control agreement between the superpowers.",,"A Close Call, but off the Clock",30-12-1899 23:53:00,1962,7,420,468.50036,520.10327
Minutes,"After the near-catastrophe of the Cuban Missile Crisis a year before and a decade of almost non-stop nuclear tests, the United States and the Soviet Union sign the Partial Test Ban Treaty, which ends all atmospheric nuclear testing. The treaty does nothing to outlaw underground testing, but it represents the first instance of concrete progress in at least slowing the arms race. It also signals awareness between the two countries that they must work together in order to prevent nuclear annihilation.",,A Rest from Tests,30-12-1899 23:48:00,1963,12,720,665.73956,216.3119
Minutes,"While the superpowers wage the Cold War, much hotter wars rage in Asia. United States involvement in Vietnam intensifies, India and Pakistan battle over Kashmir in 1965, and Israel and its Arab neighbors renew hostilities in 1967. Worse yet, France and China develop nuclear weapons in order to assert themselves as global players. This combination of conventional warfare and nuclear proliferation causes the Bulletin’s editors to move the Clock’s minute hand toward midnight. The Bulletin recognizes the possibility that these regional conflicts could flare into wider wars with the potential use of nuclear weapons.",,The Eastern World Explodes,30-12-1899 23:53:00,1968,7,420,468.50036,520.10327
Minutes,"Nearly all of the world’s nations come together to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The deal is simple: States with nuclear weapons vow to help the treaty’s other signatories develop nuclear power if they promise not to produce weapons. The nuclear weapon states also pledge to abolish their own arsenals when political conditions allow for it. Israel, India, and Pakistan refuse to sign, but the Bulletin remains cautiously optimistic: “The great powers have made the first step. They must proceed without delay to the next one—the dismantling, gradually, of their own oversized military establishments.”",,A Landmark Agreement,30-12-1899 23:50:00,1969,10,600,606.29107,349.87303
Minutes,"After more than 20 years vying for arms, the United States and Soviet Union sign two treaties that attempt to curb the race for nuclear superiority in favor of rough parity between the superpowers. The Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT) limits the number of ballistic missile launchers either country can possess. The Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty seeks to stop a race for weapons designed to shoot down an adversary’s incoming nuclear missiles. SALT leaves the two countries with thousands of warheads pointed at each other, and the United States eventually withdraws from the ABM Treaty.",,Passing the SALT,30-12-1899 23:48:00,1972,12,720,665.73956,216.3119
Minutes,"South Asia gets the bomb, as India tests its first nuclear device. Any gains in previous arms control agreements seem like a mirage. The United States and Soviet Union appear to be modernizing their nuclear forces, not reducing them. Thanks to the deployment of multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRV), both countries can now load their intercontinental ballistic missiles with more nuclear warheads than before.",,India Joins the Club,30-12-1899 23:51:00,1974,9,540,566.3119,411.44968
Minutes,"The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and the 1980 election of Ronald Reagan in the United States both serve to harden the US nuclear posture. Before leaving office in January 1981, President Jimmy Carter pulls the United States from the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow and considers ways in which the United States can win, rather than avert, a nuclear war. Reagan intensifies the hawkish posturing by scrapping any talk of arms control and proposing that the best way to end the Cold War is for the United States to win.",,Reheating the Cold War,30-12-1899 23:56:00,1981,4,240,284.84958,639.42218
Minutes,"As US-Soviet relations reach their iciest point in decades, dialogue between the two superpowers virtually stops. “Every channel of communication has been constricted or shut down; every form of contact has been attenuated or cut off. And arms control negotiations have been reduced to a species of propaganda,” the Bulletin informs readers. The United States threatens to provoke a new arms race by seeking a space-based anti-ballistic missile system.",,Stalemate and Star Wars,30-12-1899 23:57:00,1984,3,180,216.3119,665.73956
Minutes,"At the end of 1987, the United States and Soviet Union sign the historic Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, the first agreement to actually ban a whole category of nuclear weapons. The leadership shown by US President Ronald Reagan and Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev makes the treaty a reality, but Western European public opposition to US nuclear weapons inspired it. In the 1980s, both countries had increased the quantity and the deadliness of their intermediate-range missiles in Europe, keeping the continent in the crosshairs of the two superpowers.",,Protests Yield Progress,30-12-1899 23:54:00,1988,6,360,411.44968,566.3119
Minutes,"The fall of the Berlin Wall in late 1989 symbolically ends the Cold War. Between 1989 and 1991, one Eastern European country after another overthrows its Soviet-backed government, while Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev repudiates his predecessors’ policies and refuses to intervene. These revolutions end the post-World War II ideological division of Europe and significantly diminish the risk of all-out nuclear war. “Forty-four years after Winston Churchill’s ‘Iron Curtain’ speech, the myth of monolithic communism has been shattered for all to see,” the Bulletin writes.",,Lowering the Iron Curtain,30-12-1899 23:50:00,1990,10,600,606.29107,349.87303
Minutes,"With the Cold War officially over, the United States and Russia begin making deep cuts to their nuclear arsenals. US President George H.W. Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev sign the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. Known as START, the agreement greatly reduces the number of strategic nuclear weapons deployed by the two countries. Better still, a series of unilateral initiatives take most of the missiles and bombers in both countries off hair-trigger alert. The Bulletin declares: “The illusion that tens of thousands of nuclear weapons are a guarantor of national security has been stripped away.”",,A Fresh START,30-12-1899 23:43:00,1991,17,1020,684.73379,-145.39478
Minutes,"The year begins ominously when the Russian military mistakes a US-Norwegian scientific rocket for a nuclear missile and Russian President Boris Yeltsin must decide whether to launch a nuclear attack on the United States. That incident helps bolster the case made by US hard-liners that a resurgent Russia could be as much a threat as the Soviet Union. Hopes diminish for a large post-Cold War peace dividend, and more than 40,000 nuclear weapons remain worldwide. Concerns arise that terrorists could exploit poorly secured nuclear facilities within the former Soviet Union.",,A Close Call,30-12-1899 23:46:00,1995,14,840,696.14999,73.31573
Minutes,"Fourteen years after joining the ranks of countries with nuclear weapons, India carries out a series of nuclear tests that catch US intelligence off guard. The tests provoke worldwide outrage, and tensions heighten when Pakistan holds its own tests only three weeks later. The Bulletin calls the tests “a symptom of the failure of the international community to fully commit itself to control the spread of nuclear weapons.” Russia and the United States continue to serve as poor examples to the rest of the world, with a combined total of more than 7,000 weapons aimed at each other and ready to launch within 15 minutes.",,South Asia’s Nasty Surprise,30-12-1899 23:51:00,1998,9,540,566.3119,411.44968
Minutes,"After the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the United States expresses increasing concerns about nuclear weapons falling into the hands of non-state actors. A top concern is the enormous amount of unsecured—and sometimes unaccounted for—weapon-grade nuclear materials throughout the world. The United States expresses a desire to design new nuclear weapons, especially ones that can destroy hardened and deeply buried targets. It also rejects a series of arms control treaties and announces that it will withdraw from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty that it had signed with the Soviet Union in 1972.",,"New Worries, New Weapons",30-12-1899 23:53:00,2002,7,420,468.50036,520.10327

Minutes,"Just before the start of the year, a breakthrough occurs at the United Nations climate change conference in Copenhagen. Both developing and industrialized countries agree to take responsibility for carbon emissions and to limit global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius. Washington and Moscow enter talks for a follow-on agreement to START and plan negotiations aimed at further cuts in the US and Russian nuclear arsenals. The Bulletin writes, “We are poised to bend the arc of history toward a world free of nuclear weapons.”",,Hope after Copenhagen,30-12-1899 23:54:00,2010,6,360,411.44968,566.3119
Minutes,"Ridding the world of nuclear weapons, harnessing nuclear power, and managing the profound disruptions caused by climate change are complex and interconnected endeavors that the world's political processes have not fostered. The rhetoric of would-be nuclear provocateurs such as North Korea's Kim Jong-un underlines the potential for nuclear war in Northeast Asia; the nuclear situation in the Middle East and South Asia remains tense. Safer nuclear reactors with better oversight and training could help prevent power plant disasters, but technology-based approaches to managing climate change may not prevent widespread hardship.",,Desperately Seeking Solutions,30-12-1899 23:55:00,2012,5,300,349.87303,606.29107
Minutes,"Earth endures its hottest year on record. Despite some modestly positive developments in the climate change arena, current efforts are entirely insufficient to prevent a catastrophic warming of the planet. Meanwhile, the United States and Russia launch massive programs to modernize their nuclear triads-thereby undermining existing nuclear weapons treaties. The world's institutions demonstrate their lack of readiness in addressing the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, while advances in AI and cyberattacks emerged as further potential threats to international stability.

Minutes,"The hands moved less than a minute for the first time, reflecting persistence of major world threats and apprehension about Donald Trump’s intemperate statements and wanton defiance of scientific truths. New global realities emerged, as trusted information sources came under attack and fake news found an audience. North Korea conducted its fourth and fifth underground nuclear tests. Global carbon dioxide emissions were essentially flat, but have not decreased; the world continues to warm.

Minutes,"“The warning the Science and Security Board now sends is clear, the danger obvious and imminent,” as it moves the Clock hands to their closest setting since 1953, when the United States and USSR detonated the first hydrogen bombs. This year, North Korea tested its own. International diplomacy was reduced to name-calling, US-Russia relations featured more conflict than cooperation, the Iran deal was imperiled, and greenhouse gas emissions rose anew. But, wrote the Bulletin, “the opportunity to reduce the danger is equally clear. [Citizens around the world] can insist on facts, and discount nonsense. They can demand action to reduce the existential threat of nuclear war and unchecked climate change. They can seize the opportunity to make a safer and saner world.",,Obvious and Imminent Danger,30-12-1899 23:58:00,2018,2,120,145.39478,684.73379
Seconds,"Humanity continues to face two simultaneous existential dangers—nuclear war and climate change—that are compounded by a threat multiplier, cyber-enabled information warfare, that undercuts society’s ability to respond. The international security situation is dire, not just because these threats exist, but because world leaders have allowed the international political infrastructure for managing them to erode. Citizens around the world have the power to unmask social media disinformation and improve the long-term prospects of their children and grandchildren. They can insist on facts, and discount nonsense. They can demand—through public protest, at the ballot box, and in many other creative ways—that their leaders take immediate steps to reduce the existential threats of nuclear war and climate change.
